                  My journey in athletics began during my school days but truly flourished at IIT Delhi. During my first year, 
                  I participated in an 800m race at the freshers' meet and secured first place. That moment marked the beginning 
                  of a transformative athletic journey that would shape my college experience and beyond.
                </p>
                <p className={styles.introText}>
                  Previously, I was an athlete during school time, though I didn't fully realize my potential then. 
                  It was college that gave me the platform to prove it. Over four years at IIT Delhi, I progressed 
                  from a freshman talent to the Institute Vice-Captain, leading a team of 20 athletes to numerous victories.
                </p>
                <p className={styles.introText}>
                  Athletics taught me discipline, perseverance, and time managementâ€”skills that have proven invaluable 
                  in both my personal and professional life. The mental fortitude developed through sports competitions 
                  has helped me face challenges with confidence and determination.

              <p>
                Sports is one of the most effective ways to inculcate discipline in our lives. It not only made me 
                transform physically but also mentally. I understood that mental and physical attributes are correlated.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most freshers have the impression that sports would interfere with studies, but I personally did not see 
                it affecting my academics in any negative way. In fact, the routine and discipline from sports helped me 
                maintain focus in all aspects of life.
              </p>
              <p>
                The team camaraderie and support system I found in athletics were invaluable. The coaches and teammates 
                who believed in me played a crucial role in my development as both an athlete and a leader.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fitness remains an integral part of my life now. Though no longer at a professional level, 
                I continue to incorporate physical activity into my daily schedule. The habits and values 
                instilled through my sports journey continue to guide me in my professional career and personal growth.
